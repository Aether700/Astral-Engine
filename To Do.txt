	Bugs

- Scene crashes if you press the up arrow, the down arrow and then up again (check if still there after changing ECS 
	-> make is so only one component of each type is allowed before fixing)
- Input::IsKeyPressed continues to return true even when key is just held (should return true the first frame then false)

	to do

- implement text rendering (check out tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnIQEQoHHCU&t=0s, 
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8cfgcJR9Tk&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP&index=33)
- test uploadMesh, uploadVoxel and the different uploadVertexData in renderer
- finish implementing shadows (make 2 shaders, one with shadows and one without)
- check if Renderer::s_renderingBatches could be made an AUnorderedMap instead of an AUnorderedMap pointer

- change ECS so it doesn't use AReference<CallbackComponent> but does what Hazel does
- change ECS so only one component of a given type is allowed per entity

- implement layering system for the UI so we can control better what is on top of what
- fix resize so that the window hides the button and/or so that it won't resize 
	smaller than the elements inside of the window allows
- make a basic slider
- make the cursor draw the resize icons when resizing UIWindows (look at ImGui to see how they do it)

- add 3D perlin noise function to Math library (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise#Algorithm_detail)
- look at PhysX for 3D physics (https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX)
- for 2D physics look up libraries and read them to implement code

- finish Scene class (done for now?)
- moving scene camera is independant of rotation of the camera (might want to fix later)

- create config file that contains all macro stuff
- make ActionMap and Binding and stuff
